Text::Merge::Lists - v.0.28 Text/data merge with lists/table support

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P>
<PRE>        $filter = new Text::Merge::Lists($template_path);
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>        $filter-&gt;set_max_nesting_depth($intval);
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
The <CODE>Text::Merge::Lists</CODE> package is designed to extend the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> package with ``list styles'' in addition to the other formatting methods of
fields. This allows the display of fields that contain ``lists'' of items
in addition to the normal ``scalar'' fields supported by <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE>. See the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> package documentation for more information on templates and merging.

<P>
All the features of the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> package are supported and invoked in an identical fashion. The only
difference in your programs to use the <CODE>Text::Merge::Lists</CODE> object instead of the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> object is the constructor, which must be invoked with the ``Template Path''
to the directory containing your various arbitrary lists style directories,
described later. See the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> object for a description of the publishing methods available to you.

<P>
Lists can be nested, and you can use the <A HREF="#item_set_max_nesting_depth">set_max_nesting_depth()</A> object method to override the default maximum nesting depth of 3. That is
to say, you can only have a list of a list of a list by default. If you
want to nest further you will need to adjust this value. The depth limit
here is to prevent you from clobbering the perl stack (and possibly other
memory!) with deep recursion.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="List_Structure">List Structure</A></H2>
<P>
A list variable is a reference to an ARRAY of data HASH references or item
HASH references. Basically, the equivalent of the <CODE>$data</CODE> or <CODE>$item</CODE> argument to the publishing methods. If you apply a list style to a SCALAR
it will be treated as a list of one item. Undefined lists are not
considered empty, but they are undefined as one would expect. Here is an
example list assignment to the variable <CODE>$fruit_list</CODE>:

<P>
<PRE>        $apple = { 'Color'=&gt;'Red', 'Size'=&gt;'medium', 'Shape'=&gt;'round' };
        $pear = { 'Color'=&gt;'Green', 'Size'=&gt;'medium', 'Shape'=&gt;'pear-shaped' };
        $grape = { 'Color'=&gt;'Purple', 'Size'=&gt;'small', 'Shape'=&gt;'round' };
        $fruit_list = [ $apple, $pear, $grape ];
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="List_Style_Syntax">List Style Syntax</A></H2>
<P>
If you have read the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> module documentation, which is recommended, then you may be familiar with
the syntax for displaying arbitrary fields using different styles, such as
this example for a displaying a numerical value, stored in the <CODE>MyDollars</CODE> field, as a decimal value with two decimal places:

<P>
<PRE>        REF:MyDollars:dollars
</PRE>
<P>
There are many display styles available, some of which only apply to <EM>particular types of data</EM>. These are described in detail in the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> module documentation.

<P>
The <CODE>Text::Merge::Lists</CODE> object extends the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> object with support for list (ARRAY) references. By using the list style
designators, you can display lists in various contexts, just as you would
any other field value. The templates for the various lists styles are
stored in directories corresponding to the list style names. These are
located in the path provided to the constructor.

<P>
The individual items stored in the lists should be data or item HASH
references as described in the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE>
documentation. These objects have an ``ItemType'' designator, allowing the
individual list styles to display each type differently in that context.
These listing templates are plain text files, ending in '.txt' and stored
in the style directory. For example, a list style of 'showcase' stored in
the templates path <CODE>/usr/templates/</CODE> would have all of it's files stored in the path, <CODE>/usr/templates/showcase/</CODE>. If you had an item type of 'book' to display in a given list, that
template would be stored at 
<CODE>/usr/templates/showcase/book.txt</CODE>. The template will be used for each occurrence of the item type 'book' in
any list displayed using the 'showcase' style. In most cases, the listing
templates will be output ``end on end'' but that may not always be the case
as described later.  

<P>
The syntax for a reference to an item list field named, <CODE>DisplayItems</CODE>, for the example list style of 'showcase' would look something like this:

<P>
<PRE>        REF:DisplayItems:list_showcase
</PRE>
<P>
Notice the <CODE>list_</CODE> portion (that is an 'underscore'). This tells the filter that you want to
treat the field
<CODE>DisplayItems</CODE> as a list of items and use the 'showcase' list style. The system will then
look-up any templates it needs for the list in the 'showcase' directory
mentioned above.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="List_Style_Features">List Style Features</A></H2>
<P>
Each list style has various special features that you can use by providing
certain files in the list style directory. These include a <CODE>header</CODE>, a <CODE>footer</CODE>, a <CODE>default</CODE> item, and a message to display if the list is <CODE>empty</CODE>.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_List">List Header</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
The list header is an HTML fragment contained in a plain text file that is
treated by the filter as if it were part of the original document (as
opposed to a list item), it is displayed immediately before the list
itself. It is contained in the file <CODE>header.txt</CODE> in the list style directory. This file is optional.

<DT><STRONG>List Footer</STRONG><DD>
<P>
The list footer is similar to the list header described above. It is
displayed immediately following the list itself. It is contained in the
file <CODE>footer.txt</CODE> in the list style directory. This file is also optional.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Default">Default Item Type</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
You may provide a listing fragment that will be used for any item that does
not have a template in the designated list style directory. This could be
an error message, or it my display information universal to all of your
objects. You can use this item template if all of your items are very
similar and you don't want to construct a template for each item in that
style.

<P>
The default item template is located in a file called <CODE>default.txt</CODE> in the designated list style directory. This file is optional.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Empty">Empty List Message</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Similar to a header or footer, the empty list message is a file contained
in the designate style directory that is treated as part of the parent
document for display purposes, if no items exist in your list. If this file
is not provided, then empty lists are constructed as empty strings. The
file name for the empty list message is 
<CODE>empty.txt</CODE> in the designated list style directory and is optional.

<H2><A NAME="Table_Style_Syntax">Table Style Syntax</A></H2>
<P>
In addition to list styles, <CODE>Text::Merge::Lists</CODE> also supports HTML table styles. Table styles are trickier to set up than
list styles, but the principle is basically the same, and you get the
benefit of having more than one column in your list display. You maintain
full control over the styling of the individual cells and the table
attributes. All tables are HTML.

<P>
The syntax of a table style is very similar to the syntax of a list style,
but you need to specify the number of columns for the table in the tag. For
example:

<P>
<PRE>        REF:ItemList:table4_options
</PRE>
<P>
The example listed above would generate a table using the table style
defintion, ``options'', that is four columns wide. The number is required
and must be at least 1. Large numbers (&gt;10) are discouraged because they
are practically unusable.

<P>
A table generated by a table style is basically a ``grid'' of the specified
width with a ``filler'' cell at the end of the table if necessary. The
filler cell may be one or more cells wide, up to one less than the
specified table width. With this in mind, there are more restrictions on
the templates required for a table style, as described later.

<P>
Just as is the case with the list styles, individual items stored in the
lists should be data or item HASH references as described in the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> documentation. These objects have an ``ItemType'' designator, allowing the
individual table styles to display the cell for each type differently in
the same context. The cell templates are plain text files, ending in '.txt'
and stored in the table style directory.  

<P>
For example, a table style of 'options' stored in the templates path <CODE>/usr/templates/</CODE> would be located at
<CODE>/usr/templates/tables/options/</CODE>. If you had an item of type 'choice' to display in a given list, then the
cell template for display of that particular item would be <CODE>/usr/templates/tables/options/choice.txt</CODE>. Notice that the path was created by stringing together the
list-styles/template (<CODE>/usr/templates</CODE>)path, the table styles subdirectory (<CODE>tables/</CODE>), and the directory and path for the individual style and item type (<CODE>options/choice.txt</CODE>).

<P>
If you choose to construct a table style, take care to include all the
required elements. Start and finish your cell templates with the &lt;TD&gt; and &lt;/TD&gt; elements respectively. Start your header with &lt;TABLE&gt; and end it with &lt;/TABLE&gt;. Remember that the Text::Merge::Lists methods will insert the
&lt;TR&gt; and &lt;/TR&gt; elements for rows containing your cell templates. Only use &lt;TR&gt; and &lt;/TR&gt; in the header and footer files, and if you do be sure to use only
one cell in each row and use the <CODE>TableColumns</CODE> field to assign the COLSPAN for that table. Observing these few things
should keep your tables functional.

<H2><A NAME="Table_Style_Features">Table Style Features</A></H2>
<P>
Each table style has similar requirements for the files stored in the
designated table style directory. The required files include a <CODE>header</CODE>, a <CODE>footer</CODE>, a <CODE>filler</CODE> template, a <CODE>default</CODE> cell template, and the optional template to use if the list is <CODE>empty</CODE>. The <CODE>header</CODE>, <CODE>footer</CODE>, and <CODE>empty</CODE> templates will all have access to the data of the calling template, in
addition the <CODE>header</CODE> and <CODE>footer</CODE> templates will also have the additional field TableColumns set. Likewise,
the <CODE>filler</CODE> template will have the FillerColumns field set, and that must be used to
set the COLSPAN of the last table cell as described later.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Table">Table Header Template</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
The table header is contained in a file named <CODE>header.txt</CODE> in the table style directory. This file <STRONG>must contain</STRONG>
the &lt;TABLE ...&gt; element defintion. It may also contain full table rows to
start off the table. Because table styles may be invoked with a variable
column count, the field <CODE>TableColumns</CODE> is provided to use for a cell in these table rows, and while limited, it
does allow the insertion of header rows. For example, this might be the
contents of a common header.txt file:

<P>
<PRE>        &lt;TABLE BORDER=1&gt;
                &lt;TR NOSAVE&gt;&lt;TD ALIGN=CENTER 
                        COLSPAN=&quot;REF:TableColumns&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Title&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Notice the <CODE>REF:TableColumns</CODE> portion of the code, which will be replaced with the number of columns in
the table when the table is created. This allows for a ``variable width''
header that covers all columns.

<DT><STRONG>Table Footer Template</STRONG><DD>
<P>
The table footer is contained in a file named <CODE>footer.txt</CODE> and is very similar to the <CODE>header.txt</CODE> file described above. The <CODE>footer.txt</CODE> file <STRONG>must contain</STRONG> the &lt;/TABLE&gt; element closing out the table. Before that element, any number
of optional footer rows can be listed, and they too can use the <CODE>TableColumns</CODE> field to span the table columns as well. For example:

<P>
<PRE>            &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD COLSPAN=&quot;REF:TableColumns&quot;&gt;This 
                        is the last table row.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
Notice the <CODE>REF:TableColumns</CODE> field used in the the last cell definition, just as is done with the header
rows. Also notice the &lt;/TABLE&gt; listed at the very end. This basically
closes out the table and is required. You can also include other HTML after
this element if you wish, but it will not be included in the table itself.

<DT><STRONG>Table Filler Template</STRONG><DD>
<P>
The table filler cell is contained in a file named <CODE>filler.txt</CODE> in the table style directory. This is the template used for the last cell
of a table to fill the empty spaces that may be left if the number of items
in the list is not evenly divisible by the number of columns in the table.
A field named <CODE>FillerColumns</CODE> is provided to this template and it <STRONG>must be used</STRONG> to specify the COLSPAN of the cell. This template, as with all other cell
templates, must contain the &lt;TD ...&gt; and &lt;/TD&gt; elements of the
cell. This is a simple example filler cell template:

<P>
<PRE>        &lt;TD COLSPAN=&quot;REF:FillerColumns&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;this is filler&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
The filler cell will be created with a single non-blocking space character
(<EM>&nbsp;</EM>) as content if no 
<CODE>filler.txt</CODE> template file exists. 

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Item">Item Type Cell Template</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Each item in the list can be displayed based on its <CODE>ItemType</CODE> attribute if a cell template exists in the table style directory that is
named with the item type followed by the '.txt' suffix. If such a template
exists, it will be used to display the cell using the item data and
actions. Every cell template <STRONG>must contain</STRONG> the &lt;TD...&gt;...&lt;/TD&gt; elements to work properly in the table
style.

<DT><STRONG>Default Cell Template</STRONG><DD>
<P>
The default cell template will be used if there is no cell template for the
item type to be displayed. That is to say, if no file as described above
exists for the item type in question, a file called 'default.txt' will be
used to display the item. The 'default.txt' file is required if your table
style definition is be robust.

<DT><STRONG>Empty Table Template</STRONG><DD>
<P>
The empty table template is used if the list exists but contains no items.
The empty table template is contained in a file in the table style
directory named 'empty.txt'. This template will have access to all the data
and actions of the calling template. Note that if the 'empty.txt' template
is used, then none of the other templates will be used for that table style
and the results of processing 'empty.txt' will be the only thing displayed.

<H2><A NAME="Methods">Methods</A></H2>
<P>
These are the methods that extend the basic functions of the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> object. Note that we overload 
<A HREF="#item_convert_value">convert_value()</A> in order to insert our list style format recognition and interpretation.
This is very elegant and easy to do.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_new">new($liststyles)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
This method constructs a <CODE>Text::Merge::Lists</CODE> object. It basically grabs a new <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> object and then assigns the liststyles directory (which is required). If
the template path is omitted, an the call is treated as a normal <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> object request.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_convert_value">convert_value($dataref, $name, $style, $item)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
This method catches list styles and handles them, otherwise the <CODE>Text::Merge</CODE> method is used.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_set_max_nesting_depth">set_max_nesting_depth($intval)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
This method assigns the maximum nesting depth for lists. The default
maximum depth is 3.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_sort_list">sort_list($methodstr, $listref)</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
This method returns the sorted list by processing the <CODE>$methodstr</CODE> for each item in the list. A common <CODE>$methodstr</CODE> might look something like:

<P>
<PRE>        $method = 'REF:SomeField reverse numeric';
</PRE>
<P>
Which would perform a reverse numeric sort on the list. Basically a merge
is performed on the <CODE>$methodstr</CODE> and the sort algorithm is
sensitive to the keyword designators: <CODE>reverse</CODE> and <CODE>numeric</CODE>.
